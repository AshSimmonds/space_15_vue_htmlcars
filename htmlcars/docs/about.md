This Webpage and HTML LCARS Library are created by
[@Xiphoseer](https://twitter.com/Xiphoseer"), based on the
original design by Michael Okuda from Star Trek. It is heavily influenced
in theme by sites such as [GTJLCARS](https://gtjlcars.de) or
[lcarscom.net](http://web.archive.org/web/20190718150043/http://www.lcarscom.net/databank.htm), but completely
independent in terms of source code.

The commercial rights to the LCARS system are (as far as I know) held by
CBS, as part of other StarTrek asset rights. This means that, while this
source code will be released under a MIT license, you are likely not allowed
to use this libray in a commercial setting.

The font used for headings is the LCARSGTJ3 font available
[here](http://gtjlcars.de/LCARSindex/LCARSFONTS.htm). It is
provided as 'freeware' under a custom license, which states the font file
may not be renamed, modified or sold.
