# HTMLCARS

Welcome to this (open-source) implementation of the LCARS design in HTML.
This is easily my fourth clean start for this kind of project, this time
using <a target="_blank" href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a> (SCSS) as
the css preprocessor.

The colorscheme and font are taken from
<a target="_blank" href="http://gtjlcars.de">GTJLCARS</a>, a german
language resource all around the LCARS system as depicted in StarTrek
series. The text font is standard Helvetica, which the title font is based
on.

As I use firefox for prototyping, it is quite likely that this system will
be lacking behind in cross-browser compatibility, as I try to use current
web-standards where possible. This documentation is created using `vuepress`
with a custom theme based on `htmlcars`.

The goal of this project is to provide a HTML/CSS framework that can be
used to render webpages in LCARS Design, that is using state-of-the-art
web standards, does not require prefabricated images, absolute positioning,
flash or any other such software or system. If completed, there should be
multiple components and layouts available to quickly generate LCARS consoles
for any webapp.
